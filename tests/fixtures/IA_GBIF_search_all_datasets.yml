        this collection is primarily creditable to the late Ralph Wetzel. The collection
        grew as a consequence of Dr. Wetzel&#96;s NSF-supported program on the mammals
        of Paraguay. One particularly exciting and notable result of this project
        was the rediscovery of the Chacoan peccary (Catagonus wagneri), once thought
        to be extinct. Wetzel later extended his collections to several other South
        American countries. As a result, our collection includes many South American
        marsupials, canids, and rodents. We believe that this collection ranks among
        the top 5 in the world with respect to South American cats (many of the species
        included are now considered to be endangered or at risk), and among the top
        10 in its coverage of South American mammals.\n\nThe second most important
        geographic emphasis of this collection is North America with extensive series
        of a wide diversity of North American mammal species. Of particular note are
        200 bobcat skulls, 503 domesticated and feral pig skulls, 752 river otter
        skulls, and 1600 fisher skulls. Taxonomic coverage of the New England fauna
        is very good. The collection includes moderate representation of mammals from
        other regions of the world, most notably from Lebanon, Iraq, Turkistan, England,
        and Germany (reflecting the interests of previous students).","type":"OCCURRENCE","hostingOrganizationKey":"2053a639-84c3-4be5-b8bc-96b6d88a976c","hostingOrganizationTitle":"VertNet","hostingCountry":"US","publishingCountry":"US","publishingOrganizationKey":"1ef55060-54da-11dd-9d47-b8a03c50a862","publishingOrganizationTitle":"University
