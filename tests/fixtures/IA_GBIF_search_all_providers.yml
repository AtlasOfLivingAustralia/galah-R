        in November 2021 thanks to the support of the town hall. The first results
        are there, squirrels and small birds now enjoy three areas of tranquility,
        nesting boxes, feeders, waterers and replanting.By joining SOS Ecureuil Provence,
        you are making a choice: that of working towards a better future for local

        State Nature Reserve","description":"The Pinega state nature reserve  was
        founded in  August 1974. The reserve is situated in the south-eastern part
        of the Belomor-Kuloi Plateau, 110 km far from   Arkhangelsk,  on the right
        bank of the Pinega. Its area is 515 km2. The office of the reserve is in the
        village of Pinega. Its main tasks are: conservating of the nature complex
        in its natural condition, its studing and ecological enlightenment of the
        population.\r\nThe territory of the reserve is located in the zone of intensive  karst   processes.
        Underground and surface karst landscapes differ in  beauty and variety. The
        surface forms of  karst and the caves have been developed in sulphate rocks
        of the low perm. Karst was formed in the conditions of periodic effect of
        glaciers. The landscapes are developing an the influence of water and climate
        now days. The surface karst is submitted by narrows, hollows and depressions,
        sinkhole and fields of sinkholes,  circuses and outliers. The amplitude of
        the surface karst relief makes 30-60 m. The value of surface karsting makes
        500-700 forms per 1 km2, maximum one exceeds 1500 forms per 1 km2. 87 caves
        are found in the reserve and its protecting zone, 10 of them are over 1 km
        long. Their common length  exceeds 45 km. The largest caves are: Kumitchevskaya
        – 6160 m, Constituzionnaya – 6130 m. Length of the cave, mostly  suitable
        by excursion, Golubinski Fall  is 1622 m. It is situated in Golubinsky zakaznik.\r\nThe
        main water route of the reserve is river Sotka. It flows in a deep canyon
        with abrupt declines. This small «mountan» river with  rapids flows on the
        reserves territory from west on north-east during 30 km. The reserve has
        more than 400 lakes. The majority of lakes are karst on a parentage, it is
        by filled water of the sinkholes.\r\nThe reserve lies in the boreal forest
        zone, where spruce and pine forest are predominant but in some places amazing
        larch forests occupy. Forest take 89 % of the reserve''s area. About 25 %
        of the forests are primeval in the nature state. Less than 10% of the area
        is located by bogs, some small areas are covered by meadows, bushes and societies
        of light forests. \r\nThe wide development of karst processes has stipulated
        richness and originality of flora of the reserve. The total number of vascular
        plants consists of 505 species. Boreal species make  the main body  of the
        reserves  flora, the important role in its formatting belongs to the boreal
        Ural-Siberian species. 27 % of rare and relict species are represented in
        the flora of the reserve. A group of  arctalpine (Dryas octopetala, Pinguicula
        alpina) and hypoarctic (Сystopteris dickieana, Arctous alpina) relicts grow
        on gypsum tali and uncovered  declines of the karst rivers and narrows. South-taiga
        and broad-leaved forest relict species, such as, Paeonia anomala, Corydalis
        soliida, Stellaria nemorum are met  in the  flood-land of the river Sotka
        and also on the bottoms of karst narrows. 7 species are included into the
        Red Data Book of Russia. They are vascular plants - Cypripedium calceolus,
        Calypso bulbosa, Epipogium aphyllum, Dactylorhiza traunsteineri and Gypsophila
        uralensis and lichens - Lobaria pulmonaria and Brioria Fremontii\r\nThe reserve
        fauna is submitted both typical for the European northern taiga species, and
        representatives of the European broad-leaved forests: (Chaffinch, Woodpigeon,
        Bank Vole, Birch Mouse, Brown Frog), also some Siberian species (Oriental
        Cuckoo, Chipmunk, Northern Redbacked Vole, Forest Lemming, Siberian Asiatic
        Salamander) and Arctic ones (Willow Grouse).","language":"eng","email":["pinzapno@mail.ru"],"phone":[],"homepage":["http://www.zapovednik-pinega.ru/"],"logoUrl":"https://earthcape.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GBIF-invitation-Pinezhsky.jpg","address":["164610,
