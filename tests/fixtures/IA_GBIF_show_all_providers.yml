        Invertebrate Collection include large holdings of mostly marine and some tidal
        freshwater invertebrates from the full range of the U.S. East Coast from Massachusetts
        to the Gulf of Mexico, as well as some specimens from Antarctica and other
        places worldwide. An extensive part of the collection is estuarine specimens
        from the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries, represented not only by recently
        acquired specimens, but also by strong historical sampling dating back to
        the 1960s. The collection currently exceeds 6,500 taxa and over 25,000 specimens,
        with continuing growth. While the majority of the holdings are catalogued
        (3,800 lots), recently acquired specimens (2,700 lots) have not been catalogued
        yet and will be catalogued as they are digitized. Strengths of the collections
        reflect the research of current and past researchers at VIMS and highlights
        the research being done in the Chesapeake Bay; however, the collection is
        under-utilized because the records of specimens in the collection are not
        maintained in a searchable digital database. The collection is currently being
        digitized with support from a NSF grant: Documenting marine biodiversity through

        System (FBIS) is a platform for hosting, visualising and sharing freshwater
        biodiversity information for South African rivers. Through consultations with
        data users and contributors, and through collaborations with key partners
        and stakeholders, the FBIS aims to provide South Africa’s first platform for
        rapid and reliable assessments of change in freshwater biodiversity and associated
        ecosystem condition. The project seeks to mobilize and import to the system
        baseline biodiversity data, identify strategic long-term monitoring sites,
        and train key organizations on how to use the information system. Through
        the use of map-based visualisations, user-friendly dashboards and rapid data
        extraction capabilities, the system will improve knowledge of freshwater biodiversity
        and long-term river health trends, thereby supporting better-informed river
        management decisions and conservation planning projects.\n\n\nWill run a server
