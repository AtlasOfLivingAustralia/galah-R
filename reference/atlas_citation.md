# Generate a citation for occurrence data

If a `tibble` containing occurrences was generated using galah (either
via
[`collect()`](https://galah.ala.org.au/R/reference/collect.data_request.md)
or
[`atlas_occurrences()`](https://galah.ala.org.au/R/reference/atlas_.md)),
it will usually contain associated metadata stored in
[`attributes()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/attributes.html) that can be
used to build a citation for that dataset. This function simply extracts
that information, formats it, then both invisibly returns the formatted
citation and prints it to the console.

## Usage

``` r
atlas_citation(data)
```

## Arguments

- data:

  A `tibble` generated by
  [`atlas_occurrences()`](https://galah.ala.org.au/R/reference/atlas_.md)
  or similar

## Value

Invisibly returns a string containing the citation for that dataset.
Primarily called for the side-effect of printing this string to the
console.

## Examples

``` r
if (FALSE) { # \dontrun{
x <- galah_call() |>
    identify("Heleioporus") |>
    filter(year == 2022) |>
    collect()
atlas_citation(x)
} # }
```
