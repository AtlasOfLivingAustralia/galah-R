\description{
Several useful functions from \code{{tidyverse}} packages are \code{generic}, meaning
that we can define class-specific versions of those functions and implement
them in galah; examples include \code{filter()}, \code{select()} and \code{group_by()}.
However, there are also functions that are only defined within tidyverse
packages and are not generic. In a few cases we have re-implemented these
functions in \code{galah}. This has the consequence of supporting consistent
syntax with tidyverse, at the cost of potentially introducing conflicts.
This can be avoided by using the \code{::} operator where required (see examples).
}
\details{
The following functions are included:
\itemize{
\item \code{desc()} (\code{dplyr}): use within \code{arrange()} to specify arrangement should be descending
\item \code{unnest()} (\code{tidyr}): use to 'drill down' into nested information on \code{fields}, \code{lists}, \code{profiles}, or \code{taxa}
}

These (\code{galah}) versions all use lazy evaluation.
