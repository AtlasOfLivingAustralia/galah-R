\title{Get or set configuration options that control galah behaviour}
\usage{
ala_config(..., profile_path = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{\dots}{Options can be defined using the form \code{name = value}.
Valid arguments are:
\itemize{
  \item \code{atlas} string: Living Atlas to point to, Australia by default
  \item \code{caching} logical: if TRUE, results will be cached, and any cached
    results will be re-used). If FALSE, data will be downloaded.
  \item \code{cache_directory} string: the directory to use for the cache.
    By default this is a temporary directory, which means that results will
    only be cached
    within an R session and cleared automatically when the user exits R.
    The user may wish to set this to a non-temporary directory for
    caching across sessions. The directory must exist on the file system.
  \item \code{download_reason_id} numeric or string: the "download reason" required.
  by some ALA services, either as a numeric ID (currently 0--11)
  or a string (see \code{\link{find_reasons}()} for a list of valid ID codes and
  names). By default this is NA. Some ALA services require a valid
  download_reason_id code, either specified here or directly to the
  associated R function.
  \item \code{email} string: An email address that has been registered with
    ALA at \href{https://auth.ala.org.au/userdetails/registration/createAccount}{this address}.
    A registered email is required for some functions in \code{galah}.
  \item \code{send_email} logical: should you receive an email for each query to
    \code{\link{ala_occurrences}()}? Defaults to \code{FALSE}; but can be
    useful in some instances, for example for tracking DOIs assigned to
    specific downloads for later citation.
  \item \code{verbose} logical: should \code{galah} give verbose output to assist
  debugging? Defaults to FALSE.
  \item \code{run_checks} logical: should \code{galah} run checks for filters
  and columns. If making lots of requests sequentially, checks can slow down
  the process and lead to HTTP 500 errors, so should be turned off. Defaults
  to TRUE. 
}}

\item{profile_path}{string: (optional), path to a directory to store
config values in. If provided, config values will be written to a new or
existing .Rprofile file for future sessions. \code{NULL} by default.}
}
\value{
For \code{ala_config()}, a \code{list} of all options.
When \code{ala_config(...)} is called with arguments, nothing is returned
but the configuration is set.
}
\description{
The \code{galah} package supports large data downloads, and also
interfaces with the ALA which requires that users of some services
provide a registered email address and reason for downloading data. The
\code{ala_config} function provides a way to manage these issues as simply
as possible.
