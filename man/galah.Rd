\title{Download biodiversity data from the Atlas of Living Australia}
\description{
\code{galah} is an R interface to the Atlas of
Living Australia (ALA; \url{https://www.ala.org.au/}),
a biodiversity data repository focussed
primarily on observations of individual life forms.
It also supports access to some other 'living atlases' that use the same
computational infrastructure. The
basic unit of data at ALA is an \strong{occurrence} record, based on the
'Darwin Core' data standard (\url{https://dwc.tdwg.org}). \code{galah} enables users to
locate and download species observations, taxonomic information, or
associated media such images or sounds, and to restrict their queries to
particular taxa or locations. Users can specify which columns are returned
by a query, or restrict their results to observations that meet particular
quality-control criteria.

\section{Terminology}{


To get the most value from \code{galah}, it is helpful to understand some
terminology used by the ALA. Each occurrence record contains taxonomic
information, and usually some information about the observation itself, such
as its location. In addition to this record-specific information, ALA
appends contextual information to each record, particularly data from spatial
\strong{layers} reflecting climate gradients or political boundaries. ALA
also runs a number of quality checks against each record, resulting in
\strong{assertions} attached to the record. Each piece of information
associated with a given occurrence record is stored in a \strong{field},
which corresponds to a \strong{column} when imported to an
\verb{R data.frame}. See \code{\link[=show_all_fields]{show_all_fields()}} to view valid fields,
layers and assertions, or conduct a search using \code{\link[=search_fields]{search_fields()}}.

Data fields are important because they provide a means to \strong{filter}
occurrence records;  i.e. to return only the information that you need, and
no more. Consequently, much of the architecture of \code{galah} has been
designed to make filtering as simple as possible. You can use
\code{\link[=search_taxa]{search_taxa()}} to find correct taxonomic queries based on taxonomic names
or ranks.
Next, functions with the \code{galah_} prefix offer a ways to shape your query
call. Each \code{galah_} function allows the user to filter in a different way.
Again, the function suffix reveals what each one does. \code{galah_filter},
\code{galah_select} and \code{galah_group_by} intentionally match \code{dplyr}'s \code{select()},
\code{filter()} and \code{group_by} functions, both in their name and how they they are
used. For example, you can use \code{\link[=galah_select]{galah_select()}} to choose what information
is returned as columns. Alternatively, you can use \code{\link[=galah_filter]{galah_filter()}} to filter
the rows. You can also choose a specific location using \code{\link[=galah_geolocate]{galah_geolocate()}}.
By combining different filter functions, it is possible to build complex
queries to return only the most valuable information for a given problem.

A notable extension of the filtering approach is to remove records with low
'quality'. ALA performs quality control checks on all records that it stores.
These checks are used to generate new fields, that can then be used to filter
out records that are unsuitable for particular applications. However, there
are many possible data quality checks, and it is not always clear which are
most appropriate in a given instance. Therefore, \code{galah} supports ALA
data quality \strong{profiles}, which can be passed to
\code{\link[=galah_filter]{galah_filter()}} to quickly remove undesirable records. A full
list of data quality profiles is returned by \code{\link[=show_all_profiles]{show_all_profiles()}}.

For those outside Australia, 'galah' is the common name of
\emph{Eolophus roseicapilla}, a widely-distributed
Australian bird species.

\section{Package design}{


In most cases, users will be primarily interested in using \code{galah} to
return data from one of the living atlases. These functions are named with
the prefix \code{atlas_}, followed by a suffix describing the information that
they provide. For example, users that wish to download occurrence data can
use the function \code{\link[=atlas_occurrences]{atlas_occurrences()}}. Alternatively, users that wish to
download data on each species (rather than on each occurrence record) can use
\code{\link[=atlas_species]{atlas_species()}} or download media content (largely images)
using \code{\link[=atlas_media]{atlas_media()}}. Users can also assess how many records
meet their particular criteria using \code{\link[=atlas_counts]{atlas_counts()}} and return a taxonomic
tree for a specific clade from one level down to another level (e.g., from
family to genus). All functions return a \code{data.frame} as their standard
format, except \code{\link[=atlas_taxonomy]{atlas_taxonomy()}} which returns a \code{data.tree}.

Functions in \code{galah} are designed according to a nested architecture.
Users that require data should begin by locating the relevant \code{atlas_}
function; the arguments within that function then call correspondingly-named
\code{galah_} functions; specific values that can be interpreted by those \code{galah_}
functions are given by functions with the prefix \code{search_} or
\code{show_all_}; desired taxa can be also be identified using \code{\link[=search_taxa]{search_taxa()}} and
passed to the \code{taxa} argument of \code{atlas_} functions.
