\usage{
galah_config(..., profile_path = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{\dots}{Options can be defined using the form \code{name = "value"}.
Valid arguments are:
\itemize{
\item \code{atlas} string: Living Atlas to point to, Australia by default
\item \code{caching} logical: if TRUE, results will be cached, and any cached
results will be re-used). If FALSE, data will be downloaded.
\item \code{cache_directory} string: the directory to use for the cache.
By default this is a temporary directory, which means that results will
only be cached
within an R session and cleared automatically when the user exits R.
The user may wish to set this to a non-temporary directory for
caching across sessions. The directory must exist on the file system.
\item \code{download_reason_id} numeric or string: the "download reason" required.
by some ALA services, either as a numeric ID (currently 0--13)
or a string (see \code{\link[=show_all_reasons]{show_all_reasons()}} for a list of valid ID codes and
names). By default this is NA. Some ALA services require a valid
download_reason_id code, either specified here or directly to the
associated R function.
\item \code{email} string: An email address that has been registered with
ALA at \href{https://auth.ala.org.au/userdetails/registration/createAccount}{this address}.
A registered email is required for some functions in \code{galah}.
\item \code{send_email} logical: should you receive an email for each query to
\code{\link[=atlas_occurrences]{atlas_occurrences()}}? Defaults to \code{FALSE}; but can be
useful in some instances, for example for tracking DOIs assigned to
specific downloads for later citation.
\item \code{verbose} logical: should \code{galah} give verbose output to assist
debugging? Defaults to FALSE.
\item \code{run_checks} logical: should \code{galah} run checks for filters
and columns. If making lots of requests sequentially, checks can slow down
the process and lead to HTTP 500 errors, so should be turned off. Defaults
to TRUE.

Keeping for compatibility with older package versions. It is preferable to
not save \code{galah_config} options to a .Rprofile file.}

For \code{galah_config()}, a \code{list} of all options.
When \code{galah_config(...)} is called with arguments, nothing is returned
but the configuration is set.

\description{
The \code{galah} package supports large data downloads, and also
interfaces with the ALA which requires that users of some services
provide a registered email address and reason for downloading data. The
\code{galah_config} function provides a way to manage these issues as simply
as possible.

\section{Examples}{


To configure your session to allow you to download occurrence records, enter
your email in \code{galah_config()}. This email should be registered with the
ALA, which you can do
\href{https://auth.ala.org.au/userdetails/registration/createAccount}{here}

\if{html}{\out{<div class="sourceCode r">}}\preformatted{galah_config(email = "your-email@email.com")
}\if{html}{\out{</div>}}

Turn on caching in your session

\if{html}{\out{<div class="sourceCode r">}}\preformatted{galah_config(caching = FALSE)
}\if{html}{\out{</div>}}

It is required by some ALA services that you add a reason for downloading
data. To look up all valid reasons to enter, use \code{\link[=show_all]{show_all()}}

\if{html}{\out{<div class="sourceCode r">}}\preformatted{show_all(reasons)
#> # A tibble: 13 x 2
#>       id name                            
#>    <int> <chr>                           
#>  1     0 conservation management/planning
#>  2     1 biosecurity management/planning 
#>  3     2 environmental assessment        
#>  4     3 education                       
#>  5     4 scientific research             
#>  6     5 collection management           
#>  7     6 other                           
#>  8     7 ecological research             
#>  9     8 systematic research/taxonomy    
#> 10    10 testing                         
#> 11    11 citizen science                 
#> 12    12 restoration/remediation         
#> 13    13 species modelling
}\if{html}{\out{</div>}}

Add your selected reason using the option \code{download_reason_id}

\if{html}{\out{<div class="sourceCode r">}}\preformatted{galah_config(download_reason_id = 0)
}\if{html}{\out{</div>}}

You can also make debugging in your session easier by setting
\code{verbose = TRUE}

\if{html}{\out{<div class="sourceCode r">}}\preformatted{galah_config(download_reason_id = 0,
             verbose = TRUE)
}\if{html}{\out{</div>}}
}
