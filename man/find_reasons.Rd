}

A \code{data.frame} of valid download reasons, containing the id
and name for each reason.

\description{
When downloading occurrence data with \code{\link{ala_occurrences}} the
ALA APIs require a reason for download to be specified. By default, a
download reason of 'scientific research' is set for you, but if you wish to
change this you can do so with \code{\link{galah_config}()}. Use this function
to view the list of download reason code and names. When specifying a reason,
you can use either the download code or name.

This function is helpful in setting up \code{\link{galah_config}()}.
