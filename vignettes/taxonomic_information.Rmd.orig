`galah` provides multiple ways of retrieving taxonomic information, and the best
method depends of the type of information required. Below, some use cases are
outlined. 

## Searching for a single species or clade

The simplest way to get taxonomic information is to use `search_taxa`. This function
takes one or more scientific names and checks them against the ALA's taxonomy 
service.
```{r load-galah}
library(galah)
search_taxa("Chordata")
```

By default, this function shows the search term, the match (if any) within the ALA,
and some information on higher taxonomy of that clade. Critically, it also
returns a unique identifier for that clade, stored in the column 
`taxon_concept_id`. This identifer is the information that the ALA needs to 
return data that is specific to the taxon in question, i.e.:
```{r count-mammals}
atlas_counts(taxa = search_taxa("Chordata"))
```

`search_taxa` can accept a vector or a `data.frame` of taxonomic names,
and always returns a `data.frame` with the same number of rows as there are 
names to query. 

One final, useful feature of `search_taxa` is that it works in reverse. That is,
if you have a unique identifier and would like to know which taxon it refers to,
you can find that out by setting `is_id` to `TRUE`:

```{r select-taxa, eval = FALSE}
search_taxa("urn:lsid:biodiversity.org.au:afd.taxon:97764bed-9492-4066-a45f-e5b0c6c4280d", is_id = TRUE)
```

## Searching for lists of species
A common use case for atlas data is to identify the list of species that 
occur within a clade, in a particular location, or according to
some other criterion. This is provided by the `atlas_species` function.

```{r ala-species}
burrowing_frogs <- atlas_species(
  taxa = search_taxa("Heleioporus"))
str(burrowing_frogs, give.attr = FALSE)
```
`atlas_species` is similar to `search_taxa`, in that it returns taxonomic information
and unique identifiers in a `data.frame`. It differs in not being able to return 
information on taxonomic levels other than the species; but also in being more flexible 
by supporting filtering e.g.:

```{r filter-ala-species}
burrowing_frogs <- atlas_species(
  taxa = search_taxa("Heleioporus"),
  filter = galah_filter(
    stateProvince == "New South Wales", 
    year > 2010))
str(burrowing_frogs, give.attr = FALSE)
```

## Advanced taxonomic queries
Although we have focussed above on functions that are built to integrate
taxonomic concepts, the more general `galah_filter` can be used to 
build more flexible queries using the `taxonConceptID` field.
This can be useful for paraphyletic concepts such as invertebrates:

```{r invert-filter}
invertebrate_filter <- galah_filter(
   taxonConceptID == select_taxa("Animalia")$taxon_concept_id,
   taxonConceptID != select_taxa("Chordata")$taxon_concept_id)
head(atlas_counts(galah_filter = invertebrate_filter, 
                  group_by = galah_group_by("class")))
```

## Taxonomic trees

While many users want to restrict searches to particular taxa using `search_taxa()`,
there are many cases where the taxonoimc hierarchy is itself the parameter of 
investigation. In that case you can return taxonomic information as a tree
(from package `data.tree`) using `atlas_taxonomy()`. This function requires 
two arguments:
  
  - `taxa` supplies the higher taxonomic group for which data is required
  - `down_to` is the lowest rank of the taxonomic hierarchy that the user requires (see `show_all_ranks()` for valid options)

The function then searches 'downwards' from `taxa` to build the tree.


```{r search}
library(data.tree)
classes <- atlas_taxonomy(taxa = search_taxa("Chordata"), down_to = "class")
print(classes, "rank")
```


Note that if you are traversing more than 3 ranks, it might be more efficient
to use `atlas_species`, as `atlas_taxonomy` is inefficient when the search tree
is large.

### Manipulating trees

The `data.tree` package is quite rich and contains many useful functions, so we
won't attempt to give a complete overview here. Nonetheless, there are some useful
functions that might be of particular interest. A clear example is 'pruning' the tree,
for example by only retaining nodes that are from the same source (or 'authority').

```{r prune}
unique(classes$Get("authority")) # levels available in the dataset

# subset to only those nodes supplied by the Australian Faunal Directory
Prune(classes, pruneFun = function(a){a$authority == "AFD"})
print(classes, "authority")
```

Note that the above syntax is slightly unusual, in that the tree 
(`classes`) is updated even though we don't assign the result to an obect. 
This is because `classes` is an `R6` object. In fact, trees created from 
`data.tree` Nodes have a few unusual properties that we can exploit to do 
interesting things. A common task, for example, is to calculate the number of 
records present for each node in the tree. A quick way to do this would be to 
extract all the `guid` values and query them using `atlas_counts()`.
  
```{r all-counts}
counts <- lapply(classes$Get("guid"), atlas_counts)
```

While this approach works, it is inefficient, because each node has to be searched
separately. A more efficient solution is to recognise that counts for higher 
taxonomic groups/nodes should be the sum of their child nodes. We can use this 
logic to run fewer queries via the ALA, and thereby get a neater result in less time.


```{r leaf-counts}
# select only the 'leaves' (terminal nodes) of the tree
leaves <- Traverse(classes, filterFun = isLeaf)

# get data on record counts
leaf_counts <- lapply(Get(leaves, "guid"), atlas_counts)

# add back on to the tree
classes$Set(n_records = 0)
Set(leaves, n_records = unlist(leaf_counts))
print(classes, "n_records")

# sum upwards
classes$Do(
  function(a){
    a$n_records <- Aggregate(node = a, attribute = "n_records", aggFun = sum)},
  traversal = "post-order")
print(classes, "n_records")
```

The same approach can be used to find the number of species within a clade
```{r species-counts}
# get species counts
leaf_spp_counts <- lapply(
  Get(leaves, "guid"),
  function(x){ala_counts(x, type = "species")})

# add back to the tree, then sum
classes$Set(n_species = 0)
Set(leaves, n_species = unlist(leaf_spp_counts))
classes$Do(
  function(a){
    a$n_species <- Aggregate(node = a, attribute = "n_species", aggFun = sum)},
  traversal = "post-order")
  
# check results
print(classes, "n_species")
```

### Conversion

Although the tree format is useful, converting to a `data.frame` 
is straightforward.

```{r to-df}
# arrange columns by 'level'
ToDataFrameTypeCol(classes) 

# arrange columns by 'rank'
ToDataFrameTypeCol(classes, type = "rank") # works, but merges informal ranks

```

While useful, neither of the above approaches preserve the rank of each node if
there are multiple nodes in the `data.tree` returned with rank `informal` or 
`unranked`. Therefore, a more useful approach is to take more care in linking 
levels and ranks, then converting to a `data.frame`

```{r to-df-advanced}
# create a label that uniquely identifies unranked nodes
classes$Do(
  function(a){
    if(a$rank %in% find_ranks()$name){
      a$rank_level <- a$rank
    }else{
      a$rank_level <- paste0(a$rank, "-level-", a$level)
    }
  })

# use rank_level as an index to create a data.frame
df <- ToDataFrameTypeCol(classes, type = "rank_level", prefix = NULL)
df
```

If we want to take more information out of the tree, we can extract it 
and append to our new `data.frame`.

```{r add-columns}
cbind(
  df[, c("phylum", "subphylum", "class")],
  data.frame(
    auth = ToDataFrameTypeCol(classes, "authority")$authority))
```

###  Visualisation

There are a range of methods for visualising objects returned by `data.tree`. 
The `tidygraph` package can be used to convert a tree into a format suitable for 
plotting with `ggraph`.

```{r ggraph, eval = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(tidygraph)
library(ggraph)

ggraph(as_tbl_graph(classes), layout = 'dendrogram') +
  geom_edge_elbow() + 
  geom_node_label(aes(label = name), hjust = 0) +
  coord_flip() +
  scale_y_reverse(expand = expansion(add = 2)) +
  theme_void() 
```

Alternatively, the `collapsibleTree` package works on a `data.frame`.

```{r collapsible-tree, eval = FALSE}
library(collapsibleTree)
collapsibleTree(
  df,
  hierarchy = colnames(df),
  root = "Chordata",
  collapsed = FALSE,
  width = 700,
  height = 400)
```
