## Media downloads
In addition to text data describing individual occurrences and their attributes, 
ALA stores images, sounds and videos associated with a given record. These can 
be downloaded to `R` using `atlas_media()` and the same set of filters as the 
other data download functions.

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, eval = FALSE}
# Use the occurrences previously downloaded
media_data <- atlas_media(
     taxa = search_taxa("Eolophus roseicapilla"),
     filter = galah_filter(year == 2020),
     download_dir = "media")
```

As of `galah` 1.4.0, you can also do the same as above by piping with `%>%` 
or `|>`:
```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, eval = FALSE}
library(magrittr)

media_data <- galah_call() %>%
  search_taxa("Eolophus roseicapilla") %>%
  galah_filter(year == 2020) %>%
  atlas_media(download_dir = "media")
```
