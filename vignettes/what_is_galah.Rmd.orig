# About
`galah` is an R interface to biodiversity data hosted by the 
[Atlas of Living Australia](https://ala.org.au) (ALA). The ALA is a repository 
of biodiversity data, focussed primarily on observations of individual life forms. 
Like the Global Biodiversity Information Facility ([GBIF](https://www.gbif.org)), 
the basic unit of data at ALA is an **occurrence** record, based on the 
['Darwin Core'](https://dwc.tdwg.org) data standard.

`galah` enables users to locate and download species observations, taxonomic
information, record counts, or associated media such as images or sounds. Users 
can restrict their queries to particular taxa or locations by specifying which 
columns and rows are returned by a query, or by restricting their results to 
observations that meet particular quality-control criteria. All functions 
return a `tibble` as their standard format.


# Downloading data

Functions that return data from ALA (or other atlases) are named with the 
prefix `atlas_`, followed by a suffix describing the information that they 
provide.

By combining different filter functions, it is possible to build complex
queries to return only the most valuable information for a given problem.
Once you have retrieved taxon information, you can use this to [search for
occurrence records](#occurrence-data) with `atlas_occurrences()`, 
[download data on species](#species-data) with `atlas_species()`, 
[return taxonomic trees](#taxonomic-trees) with `atlas_taxonomy`, 
[retrieve numbers of records](#record-counts) with `atlas_counts()`, or 
[download media content](#media_downloads) (largely images) with `atlas_media()`.


# other living atlases
The software developed by the ALA is now used by 27 International Living Atlases. 
Although there are differences in the versions of core components used by the
Atlases, and variations in the web services available, `galah` is flexible enough to 
handle most of these differences. Below we explain how to change the Living
Atlas the package points to, and how to put in a pull request if you would like
to see another Living Atlas supported in `galah`.

## Supported Atlases
To show the Atlases currently supported by `galah`, use `show_all_atlases()`. This
function also provides information on which taxonomic source each Atlas uses.
```{r}
library(galah)
show_all_atlases()
```

## Set Atlas
Use `galah_config()` to set the Atlas to use. This will automatically populate the 
server configuration for your selected Atlas. By default, the atlas is Australia.
If you intend to download records you will need to register with the relevant
Atlas. 

```{r eval=TRUE}
galah_config(atlas = "UK", email = "your_email_here")
```

## Get data for another atlas
```{r}
atlas_counts()
```
