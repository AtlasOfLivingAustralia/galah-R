Description: The Atlas of Living Australia ('ALA') provides tools to enable users
    of biodiversity information to find, access, combine and visualise data on
    Australian plants and animals; these have been made available from
    <https://ala.org.au/>. 'galah' provides a subset of the tools to be
    directly used within R. It enables the R community to directly access data
    and resources hosted by the 'ALA'.
