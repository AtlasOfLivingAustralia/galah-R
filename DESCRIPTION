Description: The Global Biodiversity Information Facility 
    ('GBIF', <https://www.gbif.org>) sources data from an international network
    of data providers, known as 'nodes'. Several of these nodes - the "living 
    atlases" (<https://living-atlases.gbif.org>) - maintain their own web 
    services using software originally developed by the Atlas of Living 
    Australia ('ALA', <https://www.ala.org.au>). 'galah' enables the R community 
    to directly access data and resources hosted by 'GBIF' and its partner nodes.
