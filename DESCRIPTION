Description: The Global Biodiversity Information Facility 
    (GBIF, <https://www.gbif.org>) sources data from an international network of 
    data providers, known as 'nodes'. Several of these nodes - the 'living 
    atlases' (<https://living-atlases.gbif.org>) - maintain their own
    web services using a codebase originally developed by the Atlas of Living 
    Australia (ALA, <https://www.ala.org.au>). 'galah' enables the R community 
    to directly access data and resources hosted by GBIF and its partner nodes.
